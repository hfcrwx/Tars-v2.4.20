# 1 <a id="chapter-1"></a>Intro

Because tars supports multilingual development services, different development languages and environments are different, but the overall development pattern is similar.

# 2 <a id="chapter-1"></a>Development Mode

No matter what language, the development mode of service is generally as follows:
- A set of custom syntax definition and communication protocol between services
- Each language of tars provides a set of Lib library, which can quickly realize services based on the above communication protocols
- Each language service can call each other, and the protocol is same 
- Services can be packaged and published to the tars framework for management
- All services can be managed on the web platform
